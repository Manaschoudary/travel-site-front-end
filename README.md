# My React App

This is a simple React application set up with TypeScript. Below are the instructions to get started with the project.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that includes the overall layout and routing.
- `src/index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application that renders the `App` component.
- `src/components/ExampleComponent.tsx`: A functional component that can accept props and render UI elements.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `package.json`: npm configuration file with dependencies and scripts.

## Usage

You can modify the `src/components/ExampleComponent.tsx` file to create your own components and include them in the `App.tsx` file.
